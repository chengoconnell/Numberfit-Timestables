# Numberfit-Application

A duolingo-esque mobile app, helping students master their timestables and fall in love with mathematics.

## Background
With the surge of online learning, primary school students around the country have been forced into a different way of learning. The aim here is to develop an alternative solution to learning mathematics, one that does not require in-person teaching. The solution comes in the form of a mobile timestable learning application. The application aims to make maths not only fun but also convenient. This is accomplished through a variety of quick, engaging tests to train primary school pupils their basic mathematical competency. Alongside this, teachers and parents can also gain insight into the students' ability by looking at a summary of their scores, helping to inform future teaching styles and long-term strategy.
